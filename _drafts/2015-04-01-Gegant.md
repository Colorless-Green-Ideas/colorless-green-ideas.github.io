[Gegant](https://gegant.herokuapp.com/) is a non-stop [Webdav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) (icloud service for Reminders.app) <-> taskd (server for [Mirakel](http://mirakel.azapps.de/), [taskwarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/)) sync service.

Gegant leverages [MaterialDjango](https://github.com/Colorless-Green-Ideas/MaterialDjango) to create a simple, material design influenced UI.

##iCloud Notes

Of course Apple supporting an open standard like vTODOs/WebDAV comes at a price, there is no auth token scheme for server-side icloud connections. Gegant has to store your icloud password somehow. We try to do this in the most secure way. We use keyczar, django-encrypted-fields, and Heroku's envvars to provide modest protection for these credentials. Apple offers token access on its own platforms to paid-developers.

#How do others deal with this?
[ifttt](https://ifttt.com/ios_reminders), [sunrise](http://blog.sunrise.am/post/74146344289/about-icloud) both use ios apps to get tokens for local use. (note sunrise previously stored the credentials)

##upstream fixes/patches produced:
* Large work on MaterialDjango
* [cleaned up webdav's dependencies](https://bitbucket.org/cyrilrbt/caldav/commits/ddcac908290bbb90b827f584b7a96e6afcefc6b8)
* [found a redirect bug affecting iCloud](https://bitbucket.org/cyrilrbt/caldav/issue/38/caldav-barfs-on-redirect-in-urlobjectify)

##rentpunk or please buy me a beer
gegant comes with an option to support my work and to keep Colorless Green Ideas working on the core app "PizzaCat". subscribers/customers can expect benefits on pizzacat in the future. Expenses include SSL certs for gegant (putting the domain off herokuapp.com).

#do i get a t-shirt?
No. But you will get some task-preview utilities as part of the premium program. (This is some more testing of PizzaCat)
